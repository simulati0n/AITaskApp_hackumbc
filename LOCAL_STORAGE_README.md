# Task Management - Local Storage Solution

## ✅ Problem Fixed: "Failed to Fetch" Error

The error was occurring because your frontend was trying to connect to API endpoints (`/api/tasks`) but either:
- Backend wasn't running on the correct port
- Database wasn't properly configured  
- CORS issues between frontend and backend

## 🎯 Solution: Local Storage

I've updated your app to store tasks locally in the browser's localStorage instead of using API calls.

### 🚀 How It Works Now:

1. **Create Tasks**: Click "Add Task" → Fill form → Stored in browser localStorage
2. **View Tasks**: All tasks display on the calendar immediately  
3. **Edit Tasks**: Click on calendar events → Edit modal opens
4. **Delete Tasks**: Edit modal → Delete button
5. **Persistent**: Tasks persist when you refresh the page

### 🔧 What Changed:

**TaskPage.jsx**:
- `loadTasks()` now reads from localStorage instead of `/api/tasks`
- `createTask()` saves to localStorage with auto-generated ID
- Added `updateTask()` and `deleteTask()` functions
- Tasks have structure: `{id, title, description, start_time, end_time, category, priority, created_at, updated_at}`

**TaskCalendarDisplay.jsx**:
- Now accepts `onEditTask` prop to enable editing
- Click events open edit modal instead of just showing alert

### 🎨 Features Available:

✅ **Create Task**: Add Task button → Form modal  
✅ **Edit Task**: Click calendar event → Edit modal  
✅ **Delete Task**: Edit modal → Delete button  
✅ **Categories**: Personal, Work, Meeting, AI Scheduled  
✅ **Priorities**: Low, Medium, High (affects colors)  
✅ **Time Selection**: Date/time pickers  
✅ **Persistence**: Tasks saved in browser localStorage  

### 🌐 Current Status:
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:5174/ (localStorage-based)
- ⚪ Backend: Not needed for current functionality
- ⚪ Database: Not needed for current functionality

### 💡 Next Steps:
When you're ready to connect to a database later:
1. Set up your database properly (PostgreSQL/Supabase)
2. Configure environment variables
3. Replace localStorage functions with API calls
4. The UI and flow will remain the same!

**Try it now**: Go to http://localhost:5174/tasks and click "Add Task"!
